                Hello, I am Charles Kanoy, but I tend to go by Chuck. Computers as a whole interest me
                from the highest level down to the lowest. Other things that interest me include, but
                are not limited to, reading, writing, making and watching videos on YouTube, playing
                video games, watching movies, and practicing improv comedy.
                <br/><br/>
                My philosophy is to be a student of life, so any point of frustration or confusion I look
                at as a learning opportunity to optimize my life and become the best version of myself possible.
                Given enough time and effort, I believe that any adversity can be overcome. I think this
                perspective comes from the variety of people I've met during my upbringing.
                <br/><br/>
                I grew up a military brat, so I've had to move around a bit. This has brought me to
                be more adaptive to whatever challenge may come my way. This also makes me predisposed
                to move if needed.
