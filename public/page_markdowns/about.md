# So you wanna learn more about me

---
Hello, I am Charles Kanoy, but I tend to go by Chuck. Computers as a whole interest me from the highest level down to the lowest. All things sci-fi excite me. Other things that interest me include, but are not limited to, reading, writing, making and watching videos on YouTube, playing video games, watching movies, and practicing improv comedy.

My philosophy is to be a student of life, so any point of frustration or confusion I look at as a learning opportunity to optimize my life and become the best version of myself possible. Given enough time and effort, I believe that any adversity can be overcome. I think this perspective comes from the variety of people I've met during my upbringing.

I grew up a military "brat", so I've had to move around a bit. This has brought me to be more adaptive to whatever challenge may come my way. This also makes me predisposed to move if needed.
