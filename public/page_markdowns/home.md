# Hello World!

---
As you can probably guess from the title of this site, I am Charles Kanoy, an alumn of NDSU class of Spring 2021. I'm currently employed by a contingent of John Deere as an Embedded Systems Engineer. In my spare time, I'm either researching new aspects of programming and computers, spending time with those I hold dear, cooking, or reading.
