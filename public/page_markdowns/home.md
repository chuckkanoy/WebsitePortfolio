# Hello World!

---
I am Charles Kanoy, an alumn of NDSU class of Spring 2021. I'm currently employed full-time at John Deere as a Software Design Engineer creating production software for JLG. Before that I was a HIL Engineer at John Deere, supporting testing for various teams. In my spare time, I'm either researching new aspects of programming and computers, spending time with those I hold dear, cooking, or reading.
