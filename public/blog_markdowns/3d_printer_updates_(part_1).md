# 3D Printer Updates (Part 1)

About a year ago, I picked up an Ender 3 and have been privileged to some of the joys of 3D printing since. Benefits include but are not limited to an abundance of desk toys and fidgets, world peace, and neat pencil holders. I have also endured some of the more challenging aspects of 3D printing including difficulty maintaining a calibrated bed and removing finished prints from the cooling bed. Additionally, there are dilemmas that can come from having the stock plastic extruder for an extended period of time. After dealing with these issues for the greater part of a year and a couple of conversations with coworkers, I decided it was time to get to work on upgrading my Ender 3.

I knew I wanted to keep the cost of my initial upgrades to a minimum, just to make sure this was an aspect of the hobby that I actually wanted to participate in. For the issue of maintaining a calibrated bed, I purchased higher resistance bed-leveling springs with metal knobs for adjustment. For the issue removing prints from the cooling bed, I purchased a removable, magnetic build plate. I bought an all metal extruder to remove the possibility of any intense wear in the extruder handle. Another issue that I had heard about but not experienced myself is the filament tubing melting down and bonding with the hot end. It is also fairly fragile and can break if bent to too extreme an angle. To save myself another headache, I bought Bowden filament tubing.

Installing these upgrades was fairly straightforward. The only part of the installation process that caused me some difficulty was installing the all metal extruder because I stored my old extruder parts near the new ones (along with some spare parts from the rest of the upgrades). I needed to change the screw that maintains the extruder spring tension because the screw I was using (likely the one that did not come with the extruder) was not long enough to adjust the tension. Once I used the correct screw and adjusted the tension just right, my extruder was drawing the right amount of filament for my prints.

After everything was installed, my 3D printer produced a pretty clean Benchy. I can safely say that I enjoyed the process of upgrading my Ender 3 and would definitely consider it an essential part of the hobby to assure improved consistent quality prints.
