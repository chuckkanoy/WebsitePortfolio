        Hello, I am Charles Kanoy, but I usually tend to go by Chuck just because that's easier for everyone. I'm currently a junior going to university at North Dakota State University. I am very interested in full-stack web development and desktop application
        development, but I am also curious to learn new things and open to any experience with programming in a professional capacity. My resume shows the languages with which I have experience.
        <br><br> Now for a little bit about me personally! I enjoy reading and writing in multiple different genres. I am very interested in comedy and am currently the secretary on the board of my improv troupe, "To Be Determined Comedy". Get it? Like
        the name is still to be determined but that's the actual name. Nevermind. On top of these things, I try to challenge myself with personal programming projects to expand my abilities.
        <br><br> Thank you so much for visiting my site, and I hope you enjoy your stay!
